## Introduction to Machine Learning: Coursework 1 (Decision Trees)

### Data

The ``data/`` directory contains the datasets for the coursework.

The primary datasets are:
- ``train_full.txt``
- ``train_sub.txt``
- ``train_noisy.txt``
- ``validation.txt``

Some simpler datasets to help with implementation or debugging:
- ``toy.txt``
- ``simple1.txt``
- ``simple2.txt``

The official test set is ``test.txt``.


### Codes

- ``classification.py``

	* Contains the code for the ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` class. The ``train()`` and ``predict()`` methods were implemented as part of this coursework.


- ``improvement.py``

	* Contains the code for the ``train_and_predict()`` function. This function was completed as an interface to the new/improved decision tree classifier.
